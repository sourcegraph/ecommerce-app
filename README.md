# Amp Demo App

This repository is a carefully crafted demo that showcases the capabilities of Amp, centered around an example e-commerce platform featuring a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. Data is stored in SQLite, so it is self-contained and easy to run.

For more information about Amp visit the [Amp manual](https://ampcode.com/manual).

## How to use this repo

Follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide to get started. Once the front and back ends are running (with the `just dev` command), then you can open your browser on one side of the screen with Amp up on the other (in VS Code or the CLI).

See the [DEMO.md](DEMO.md) for more information about how to effectively use this repo for an array of different demo purposes ranging from issue to PR to advanced feature adds.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Dev Container

The fastest way to get started! No local installation beyond Podman required.

**What you need:**

- Podman Desktop ([download](https://podman-desktop.io/)) or Podman CLI (`brew install podman`)
  - Make sure you dedicate enough resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) in your podman virtual machine in [settings](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/podman/creating-a-podman-machine)
- VS Code with [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- VS Code setting: `"dev.containers.dockerPath": "podman"`

**Setup:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sourcegraph/ecommerce-app.git
cd ecommerce-app
code .
```

Run through the GitHub auth flow one time (it will persist):

```bash
gh auth login
```

Ensure Amp is authenticated

- VS Code should automatically authenticate if you have on your local machine
- Run `amp` in the terminal and follow the one time login flow

Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted. First build takes ~3-5 minutes, then it will be cached, then:

```bash
just dev    # Start both frontend and backend
```

Access the application on your local browser (ports will automatically be forwarded):

- Frontend: http://localhost:3001
- Backend API: http://localhost:8001

**What's included:** Python 3.13, Node.js 22, all dependencies, Playwright browsers, GitHub CLI, Amp CLI, and all VS Code extensions pre-configured. Amp is set to run in Autonomous mode (most non-destructive commands allowed by default) with Playwright MCP and internal cost display **disabled**.

See [.devcontainer/README.md](.devcontainer/README.md) for detailed documentation and troubleshooting.

### Option 2: Local Installation

For direct installation on your host machine:

1. [Install Amp](https://ampcode.com/) (VS Code extension and/or CLI)

2. Install the prerequisites and clone the project:

```bash
# Install homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install just
brew install just

# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env

# Install python
uv python install 3.13 --default

# Install node
brew install node

# Install gh CLI and authenticate
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

```bash
# Verify you have the required tools
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
just --version
python --version
uv --version
node --version
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sourcegraph/ecommerce-app.git
cd ecommerce-app
```

3. Install dependencies and setup testing:

```bash
just install-all      # Install all dependencies (backend, frontend, E2E browsers)
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
just dev             # Start both services with native hot-reload using concurrently
```

Access the application:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3001
- Backend API: http://localhost:8001

## Development Commands

### Lifecycle Commands

```bash
just dev              # Start both services (native hot-reload, interactive)
just dev-headless     # Start both services in background (for agentic development)
just stop             # Stop headless services
just dev-backend      # Start only backend
just dev-frontend     # Start only frontend
```

### Seed Database

```bash
just seed             # Populate database with sample data (only needed if database changes)
```

### Manual Development (individual services)

Install dependencies (if not already done):

```bash
just install-all      # All dependencies (backend, frontend, E2E browsers)
```

Run services individually (if needed):

```bash
just dev-backend      # Start only backend
just dev-frontend     # Start only frontend
```

### Testing & Quality

#### Setup E2E Testing (Required First Time)

```bash
just setup-e2e        # Install Playwright browsers
```

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
just test-local                        # Backend tests
just test-cov-local                    # Backend tests with coverage
just test-local-single TEST            # Run single test

# E2E tests (Playwright)
just test-e2e         # E2E tests (headless)
just test-e2e-headed  # E2E tests (headed - for debugging)

# Combined test suites
just test-all-local   # All tests (backend + E2E)
```

**Note:** Frontend has no unit tests - only E2E tests with Playwright that test the full application.

#### Code Quality

```bash
# backend
just check            # Run linting (ruff) and type checking (mypy)
just format           # Format backend code

# frontend
just lint             # Lint frontend TypeScript
```

#### Pre-Push Validation (Recommended)

Before pushing to CI, ensure all checks pass locally to avoid CI failures:

```bash
# One-time setup (if not done already)
just install-all      # Install all dependencies

# Run complete CI pipeline locally
just ci               # Runs: lint, tests, build, e2e (mirrors CI exactly)
```

`just ci` runs the exact same checks as the GitHub Actions CI pipeline:

1. **Backend Quality**: Ruff linting + MyPy type checking
2. **Backend Tests**: Full test suite with coverage
3. **Frontend Quality**: ESLint + TypeScript build
4. **E2E Tests**: End-to-end Playwright tests

### Build & Deployment

```bash
just build            # Build frontend for production
cd frontend && npm run build  # Alternative frontend build
```

### Database Management

```bash
just reset-db         # Reset SQLite database
just db-shell         # Open SQLite CLI
just migrate-create "message"  # Create new migration
just migrate-up       # Apply migrations
just migrate-down     # Rollback migration
```

### Monitoring & Debugging

```bash
just health           # Check service health
just logs             # View last 100 lines from backend and frontend logs
just logs-follow      # Follow both logs live (Ctrl+C to exit)
```

**Headless Development Workflow:**  
When using `just dev-headless` for agentic development, services run in the background and log to `logs/backend.log` and `logs/frontend.log`. Use `just logs` to inspect output and `just stop` to stop the services.
